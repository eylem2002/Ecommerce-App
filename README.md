# ecommerce

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started


Tokoto mobile application built with Flutter, a popular framework for developing cross-platform applications. 
Key Features:
Product Display:

The app displays a list of popular products on the home screen.
Each product is represented by a card containing essential details such as image, title, price, and a brief description.
Navigation:

Users can tap on a product card to view more details on a dedicated screen (implemented in DetailsScreen).
The "See More" button suggests the possibility of navigating to a broader product catalog or a dedicated page for more products.
Favorite Products:

Users can mark products as favorites by interacting with the heart icon on each product card (handled in the onFavoriteChanged callback).
This implies a feature where users can create a list of their favorite products.
Scalability:

The code is structured to handle a dynamic list of products, allowing for scalability as the product catalog expands.
API Integration (Potentially):

Although not explicitly implemented in the provided code, the app could fetch product data from an external API (e.g., using the http package) to keep product information up-to-date.
